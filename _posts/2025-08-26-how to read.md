How to be an active demanding reader 

- Ask questions while you read!!! Ask the right questions in the right order
- 4 questions you must ask:
- 1. What is the book about as a whole?
- 2. What is being said in detail and how? 
- 3. Is the book true in whole or in part?
- 4. What of the information you have learnt? What next?

Ask these as you read! You must know how to answer them as you go. Get a pencil and write your answers in between the lines.
Writing  your notes during reading helps you remember thoughts from writer. Expression of differences with author. It is HIGHEST RESPECT TO AUTHOR.
Writing in margin with questions or notes. Circle.
