# Model validation

What is validation of a model?
A model is valid when it takes in sensible inputs and outputs sensible outputs. Model validation is the
process we go through checking that the model works for it's intended
purpose.

Remember: ``All models are wrong, but some are useful'' George Box.

What are strategies to validate a new model? - Empircal validation:
Compare to real building dat - Intermodel validation: comparing to other
models - Analystical validaition: simple test casese to verify algoritms

Empirical validation- look at measurement and uncertainty error of data
sources Intermodel validation - no absolute truth inputs.

Validation metrics - NMBE - Normalised mean bias error - CV RMSE
-Coefficient of Variation of Root mean square error
