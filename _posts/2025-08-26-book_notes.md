## Man's search for meaning
What is the book about:
Story of Victor Frankl going through concentration camps and making a meaning of life. 
His conclusions were: 
There are three paths for meaning in life:
1. **Accomplishment in doing a deed**
2. Experiencing something or someone
3. If you have no other option and are in a circumstance where you have no option. There is meaning in suffering. **Suffer bravely.** 

## Hot air: Sustainable energy


David Mackay was a british physicist who did a lot of number crunching to find out what is the actual feasbility of becoming sustainable. This post is my summary of his book Sustainable Energy without hot air. 
 
## Motivation for the book

- Bad media advice
- Fossil fuels are a finite resource
- Security of energy supply
- Fossil fuels change the climate

Who has responsibiltty? Countries with higher than average emissions. The polluter should pay.

## The balance sheet

| Energy out  | Energy in |
| ----- | ----|
| Heating and cooling | Solar |
| Transport | Wind |
| Lighting | Hydroelectric |
| Electronics | Wave |
| Food | Tide |
| Manufacturing | Geothermal |
| Public services | Nuclear|

Notes (Sept 2024)
- Wind currently approx 30% for UK grid
- Solar 5% for UK grid
- Biomass 7% for UK grid
- Hydro 1% for UK grid
- Nuclear 10% for UK grid

- Heating and cooling - 30%
- Transport - 40%
- Lighting - 3%

Approximately 42.3% of the UK energy mix comes from renewables, with wind contributing about 29.5%, biomass 6.8%, solar 4.7%, and hydro 1.3%

## Transport
### Cars
energy used per day = (distance travelled per day / distance per unit of fuel) * energy per unit of fuel

distance travelled per day = 50 km
distance per unit of fuel = 33 miles per gallon = approx 12 km per litre
energy per unit of fuel = 
- lateral thinking!:
  - petrol is hydrocarbons
  - hydrocarbons can be found in butter
  - butter is 8 kwh per kg
  - less than water since it floats so say 80% of water
  - 7kWh per litre 
in reality it's about 10 kwh per litre.

energy used per day = (distance travelled per day / distance per unit of fuel) * energy per unit of fuel
= ( 50 / 12 ) * 10 = 40 kWh/day

### Planes
A boeing 747:
- capacity: 416 people
- fuel: 240,000 L
- distance (london to cape town) = 14,200 km (round trip)

(2 * 240,000 / 416 )*10 = 12,000 kwh per passenger per year
12000 / 365 = 33 kwh/day



## Heating and cooling

Water heating demand
---
- baths
- showers
- sinks
- kettles
- cookers
- dishwasher
- tumble dryer

Space heating demand
----
- conduction loss
  - P = A * U * delta T
  - E = A * U * (delta T * duration)
- ventilation loss
  - N - number of air changes per hour
  - P = C * N * V * delta T
  - E = 1/3 * N * V * (delta T * duration)

Energy_lost = leakiness * Temp_demand<br>
Energy_consumed = Energy_delivered / COP

Reduce energy consumption
----
- Reducing Temp demand
  - lower thermostat
- Reducing leakiness
  - increase fluff
  - increase glazing
  - new doors for draught proofing
  - smaller house!
- Increasing COP
  - heat pumps

## Light
- brightest domestic light bulbs about 250W
- home: 2.7 kWh per day
- work: 1.3 kWh per day
- total 4 kWh/day

## Gadgets
- vacuum cleaner: 0.2 kWh/day
- lawn mowers: 0.6 kWh/day
- others
- total = 5kWh/day

## Food and farming
- avg person with 2600 calories
- 2600 calories is approx 3 kWh
- milk
- eggs
- meat

## Creating Stuff
- Raw materials phase
- Production into manufacturered product phase
- Use case phase
- Disposal phase
  - recycling (back into raw materials)
  - landfill (put it into a hole)

The stuff
- coke cans
- other packaging
- computers
- batteries
- newspaper
- house
- car
- Transporting by road, water

## Public services
- Defence - 4 kWh/day
# Production

## Wind
- power per person = wind power per unit area * area per person

# How to live by Derek Sivers

What a great book! Should be compulsory reading for everyone.

1. Be independant. 
- Do what you would do if you were the only person on Earth?
- Say unlablled and unbounded
- When you are indifferent to other people's actions, no one can harm you
- keep your friends close but not too close
- don't worry about being lonely, it's always better to be alone
- learn the skills to be self reliant
- don't depend on any tech company. have your own backups
- don't depend on any one country or culture
- you appreciate family, once they're not forced upon you

2. Learn to commit
- you action makes any choice great
- remove the option to change your mind
- less is more
- get the deeper pleasure of diving into one choice
- focus on the few things you're commited to, be okay with cutting off the others
- trust and show you can be trusted
- be reapeatedly good, your habits decide who you are 
- commit to one career path, if you are commited you can't fail, if you never give up it's not failure.
- you will feel free once you commit

3. Fill your senses
- fill your senses as if it's your last day on earth
- see all places, eat all food, hear all music
- nothing twice. never eat the food twice.  
- always forward. push yourself hard.

3. Do nothing
- action has the opposite effect of the intended purpose. Do nothing.
- Try hards, fail e.g if you try be liked, you will be annoying.
- Be stil and listen. No craving and no fixing. 
- Want nothing.
- Skip the action to get the emotion. you don't need a beach to feel calm.
- The whole experience is in your mind. Focus on the internal.
- Problems. Identify what belief is really the source of the trouble? You decide to feel forward motion, but really you don't neeed to decide then. 
- Just because someone asked you a question doesn't mean you need to answer it
- When people give you opinions - add a ? to it. Don't jump to conclusions
- The wise just observe. Take your time  to decide. Watch the world. Do nothing.


4. Think SUPER long term
- delay gratification
- spend money that give long term gratification 
- don't spend, only invest.
- Each choice is somethign you should be able to make forever.

5. Interwine with the world
- travel and experience different cultures
- move. think "we" not "they"


6. Make memories
- when you are young time goes slowly because everything is new
- when you are older, time flies by forgotton, because you're not having as many new experiences
- monotony is the enemy. Novelty is the solution.
- unique experiences anchor you
- document everything
- journal everyday, thoughts and experiences
- compile photos and videos so they are appealing to watch
- make your experiences into stories
- remember only what you want to remember - good mememories only!
- make memories is how you live


7. Master something
- mastery is the ultimate status
- stay in flow of fascinating flow
- the most rewarding things take years
- passion starts after you get good
- a good goal makes you act immediately
- the challenge is staying on the path
- never miss a day. someone is practicing when you are not
- during work, do nothing but work
- take tiny breaks to last longer
- you want pressure and stress. It will make you stronger.
- be sharply focussed.
- amplify your strenghts
- do one thing really really well.

8. Let randomness rule
- have a random generator make your decisions. Allow it to make you do different things and skills. 
- we have little free will in our decisions 
- everything is random too. be indifferent to outcomes.
- all you can do is control your reaction
