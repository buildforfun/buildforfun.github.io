# Machine learning

1. Collect data
2. Prepare data
3. Split data: test, train and validate
4. Train model
5. Test and validate model
6. Deploy model

## Deep learning
- subset of ml - mulilayered neural networks
1. Input image
2. Convolutional layers + pooling
3. fully connected layer
4. output class

## Validation of ML
- training - model learns the task
- validation - which model is best?
- test - how good is the model truly?
