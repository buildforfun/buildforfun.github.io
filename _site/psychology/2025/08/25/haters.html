<p>No one likes haters. We try our best to remove the existence of haters or negative people in our lives as much as possible, but somehow these people find a way in. How should you handle these haters? Haters need attention and they want to control other people because they lack a control of their own lives. Remember you cannot fix them. You can only control your response to them. Here are some strategies we can use to respond to haters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is what they said true?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If yes, why be upset. They have stated the truth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If no, inform them of the truth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you even respect the person?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If yes, thank them for informing you and use it to improve.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If no, be relieved, you must be doing something right.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use humour. Humour can dispense tension in many situations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accept it, ignore it and outwork them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you aren’t ashamed of something, you won’t care if people tease you about it. The shame comes from a misguided sense that you’re supposed to be perfect.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
