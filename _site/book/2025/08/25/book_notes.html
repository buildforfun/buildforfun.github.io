<p>What is the book about:
Story of Victor Frankl going through concentration camps and making a meaning of life. 
His conclusions were: 
There are three paths for meaning in life:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Accomplishment in doing a deed</strong></li>
  <li>Experiencing something or someone</li>
  <li>If you have no other option and are in a circumstance where you have no option. There is meaning in suffering. <strong>Suffer bravely.</strong></li>

<p>David Mackay was a british physicist who did a lot of number crunching to find out what is the actual feasbility of becoming sustainable. This post is my summary of his book Sustainable Energy without hot air.</p>

<h2 id="motivation-for-the-book">Motivation for the book</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Bad media advice</li>
  <li>Fossil fuels are a finite resource</li>
  <li>Security of energy supply</li>
  <li>Fossil fuels change the climate</li>
</ul>

<p>Who has responsibiltty? Countries with higher than average emissions. The polluter should pay.</p>

  <li>Wind currently approx 30% for UK grid</li>

<p>Approximately 42.3% of the UK energy mix comes from renewables, with wind contributing about 29.5%, biomass 6.8%, solar 4.7%, and hydro 1.3%</p>
