  <li>4 questions you must ask:</li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>What is the book about as a whole?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>What is being said in detail and how?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Is the book true in whole or in part?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>What of the information you have learnt? What next?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ask these as you read! You must know how to answer them as you go. Get a pencil and write your answers in between the lines.
