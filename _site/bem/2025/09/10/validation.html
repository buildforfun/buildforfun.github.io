<h1 id="model-validation">Model validation</h1>

<p>What is validation of a model?
A model is valid when it takes in sensible inputs and outputs sensible outputs. Model validation is the
process we go through checking that the model works for it’s intended
purpose.</p>

<p>Remember: ``All models are wrong, but some are useful’’ George Box.</p>

<p>What are strategies to validate a new model? - Empircal validation:
Compare to real building dat - Intermodel validation: comparing to other
models - Analystical validaition: simple test casese to verify algoritms</p>

<p>Empirical validation- look at measurement and uncertainty error of data
sources Intermodel validation - no absolute truth inputs.</p>

<p>Validation metrics - NMBE - Normalised mean bias error - CV RMSE
-Coefficient of Variation of Root mean square error</p>
