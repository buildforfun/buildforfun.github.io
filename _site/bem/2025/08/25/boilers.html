<ol>
  <li>Natural Gas delivery
    <ul>
      <li>Natural gas is sourced, extracted, and delivered to buildings through an extensive network of pipelines that cover long distances.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Combustion chamber
    <ul>
      <li>Once the gas is inside the building, it’s transported to the boiler’s combustion chamber where the combustion process is carried out.</li>
      <li>When natural gas is mixed with oxygen and ignited, it creates a flame, and thus the desired heat.</li>
      <li>The process also creates waste gases in the form of hot water vapour and carbon dioxide.</li>
      <li>Most modern combi boilers feature a modulating burner which can adjust its output for the demand.</li>
      <li>The heat created by flame is transmitted to the primary heat exchanger.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Primary heat exchanger
    <ul>
      <li>The primary heat exchanger consists of copper pipes which carry water in parallel lines to capture as much of the heat from the gases as possible.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Circulation pump
    <ul>
      <li>An electric circulation pump circulates the water throughout the heating system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Space heating
    <ul>
      <li>For space heating, hot water flows into the radiators when Thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) are turned up.</li>
      <li>The water, having released heat into the room, returns to the boiler at a lower temperature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Diverter valve
    <ul>
      <li>When the hot water is needed, the diverter valve redirects hot water from the primary heat exchanger to the secondary heat exchanger for hot water production. Priority is given to delivering hot water over space heating.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Secondary heat exchanger
    <ul>
      <li>Hot water is delivered by the secondary heat exchanger. In condensing boilers, the flue gases are passed over a secondary heat exchanger, recovering additional heat from the combustion process.</li>
      <li>Mains Cold water is fed into the secondary heat exchanger, heated by flue gases and hot water from the primary heat exchanger and then delivered to the taps.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Flue
    <ul>
      <li>Cold exhaust gases are vented through the flue pipe</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
