<p>Muay thai is a striking martial arts, it is often referred to as the art of 8 limbs because it uses hands, elbows, knees, and feet to strike the opponent. I signed up to Muay thai in June 2022. I had quite a lot of weight from COVID and I wanted to shed it.  Since then I have been doing Muay thai and honestly it’s been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.  I lost over 10kg in a the space of 6 months.</p>

<p>I remember after my first class I couldn’t even move. My body was aching all over the next day. Your body become efficient with the movement. I wasn’t very consistent for the first 1.5 years to be honest but showing up still does wonders. It’s only recently when I increased my classes to 2x a week that I’ve noticed real progress.</p>

      <li>Swing rear arm and pull your hip up to the target</li>
      <li>Whole of body should be past the centre line</li>
      <li><strong>Knee comes up vertically</strong> and  just before impact it cuts/turns into the target but arcing at the very end - lead with the knee and go across the target.</li>
      <li>Your hip only snaps a second before impact</li>
      <li>At point of impact knee + hip should be past centre line</li>
      <li>imagine cutting through the target - like a baseball bat going through</li>
      <li><strong>Don’t swing out the leg</strong> - stay in</li>
      <li>Arm swing - harder you swing that arm the more force you will drive through</li>

<p><strong>Sparring</strong> <strong>tips</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Recognise an opponent’s patterns in techniques can allow you to disrupt their rhythm and capitalise on anticipated moves.</li>
  <li>Observing an opponent’s footwork can reveal vulnerabilities, such as being flat-footed or slow to move laterally, which can be exploited with counter-attacks or angled attacks</li>
  <li>Aim to go forward</li>
  <li>Don’t lower arms</li>
  <li>Feint a lot - throws opponent off</li>
  <li>See the opening for a kick - where are they exposed</li>
  <li>Use punches first to distract the opponent. Then kick so they can’t see it coming</li>
  <li>Understand your range/bubble - will my hand/foot reach the target</li>
</ul>
